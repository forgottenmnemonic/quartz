Here is a simple cheat sheet for some of the most common Git and GitHub commands you can use in your terminal:

1. Initialize repository: `git init`
2. Check status of working directory: `git status`
3. Add files to staging area: `git add <file>` or `git add .` (to stage all changes)
4. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
5. View commit history: `git log`
6. Check the difference between commits: `git diff`
7. Create a new branch: `git branch <branch-name>`
8. Switch to a different branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`
9. Merge one branch into another: `git merge <branch-name>`
10. Push changes to GitHub: `git push origin <branch-name>`
11. Clone a repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`
12. Fetch remote changes: `git fetch origin`
13. Pull remote changes and merge into your current branch: `git pull`
14. Make a temporary change without committing it: `git stash` (to save the changes), `git stash apply` (to apply them later) or `git stash pop` (to both apply and delete the stashed changes).
15. Undo your last commit: `git reset HEAD~1` (this will remove the last commit but keep the changes in the working directory) or `git reset <commit-hash>` (to go back to a specific commit).
