ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
  - Salt/pepper, to taste
  - 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 1/4 cups white long-grain rice, uncooked
  - 2 cups fresh broccoli florets, uncooked
  - 10.5 oz condensed cream of chicken soup
  - 1/2 cup milk
  - 1/2 cup sour cream
  - 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, separated
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
  - Add the chicken broth, olive oil, and rice to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover tightly and cook for 6 minutes.
  - Add the broccoli and replace the cover. Cook for 9 more minutes, or until no liquid remains in the pot and the rice is cooked through. (If not cooked, simmer for an additional 5 minutes.)
  - Turn off the heat and leave the cover on. Let the rice stand for 10 minutes without stirring.
  - Add the cream of chicken soup, milk, sour cream, optional seasonings, and half of the cheddar cheese to the pot of rice. Stir to combine.
  - Transfer the mixture to a lightly greased 9x13 casserole dish. Top with the remaining cheese. Cover and bake for 15 minutes.
