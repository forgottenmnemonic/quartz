ingredients:
  - 155 g ketchup
  - 25 g dark brown sugar, packed
  - 1½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar
  - ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 medium yellow onion, minced
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1¼ teaspoon salt
  - ¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 teaspoons paprika
  - 1 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 1½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
  - 1½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
  - 2 large eggs
  - 900 g ground turkey (93/7)
  - 90 g Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
  - A few sprigs chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)
directions:
  - Set oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil and grease the foil with olive oil or non-stick cooking spray.
  - Make the Glaze. In a medium bowl, whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard. Set aside.
  - Make the Meatloaf. Heat the olive oil in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Do not brown. Set aside to cool.
  - In a large bowl, combine the salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, eggs, and ¼ cup of the BBQ glaze. Whisk until well combined. Stir in the onion mixture. Add the ground turkey and breadcrumbs and mix with your hands until evenly combined.
  - Transfer the meat mixture into two even piles onto the prepared baking sheet. Shape into two long loaves about 1½ in high x 6 in long x 4 in wide. Spread the remaining BBQ glaze over the loaves, letting it drip down the sides a bit. Bake for about 45 minutes, until the meatloaves are cooked through. Scrape any fat away from the sides of the loaves, then transfer the loaves to a platter. Slice and garnish with parsley if desired.
