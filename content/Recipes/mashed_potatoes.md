ingredients:
  - 2 pounds (900g) russet potatoes
  - Kosher salt
  - 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, plus more as needed
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter (85g), room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pats
  - Freshly ground black pepper
directions:
  - Peel potatoes and cut into 1- or 2-inch cubes. Transfer to a pot of cold water and rinse, changing water 2 or 3 times until it runs clear. Cover potatoes with fresh cold water and season generously with salt.
  - Set the pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 15 minutes after reaching a simmer.
  - Drain potatoes in a colander and rinse under hot running water for 30 seconds to remove excess starch. Let them steam for 1 minute to remove moisture.
  - Using a ricer or food mill, pass potatoes through into the now-empty pot.
  - Add butter and gently fold it into the potatoes until incorporated.
  - Mound potatoes in the center of the pot and pour milk around the edges. Set over medium heat and bring milk to a simmer before folding it into the potatoes.
  - For creamier potatoes, add more milk using the same methodâ€”pouring around the edges, simmering, and folding in.
  - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve warm.
