ingredients:
  - 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
  - 2 tablespoons brown sugar
  - 1 ⅛ teaspoons salt
  - 3 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C), divided
  - 3 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 cup bread flour
  - 2 tablespoons baking soda
  - 2 tablespoons butter, melted
  - 2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt
directions:
  - In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast, brown sugar, and 1 ⅛ teaspoons salt in 1 ½ cups warm water. Stir in all-purpose and bread flour, kneading on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let rise for one hour.
  - Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 6 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine 2 cups warm water and baking soda in an 8-inch square pan.
  - After dough has risen, cut into 12 pieces. Roll each into a 3-foot rope, pencil thin or thinner. Twist into a pretzel shape, dip in baking soda solution, and place on prepared sheets. Let rise 15 to 20 minutes.
  - Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with coarse kosher salt, garlic salt, or cinnamon sugar.
