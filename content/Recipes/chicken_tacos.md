ingredients:
  - 1 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained
  - 1/2 cup chicken broth
  - 1-2 canned chipotle chilies in adobo
  - 2 cloves garlic, peeled
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 12 6-inch corn tortillas, warmed
  - 3/4 cup crumbled queso fresco
  - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
  - Lime wedges, for serving
directions:
  - In a blender, combine the tomatoes, broth, chipotle chilies, garlic, and cumin. Cover and blend until smooth.
  - Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Select sauté on the Instant Pot and adjust to normal. Heat the oil in the pot. Add the chicken and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until browned.
  - Add the blended tomato mixture to the pot. Press cancel. Secure the lid on the pot and close the pressure-release valve.
  - Select manual and cook at high pressure for 5 minutes. When cooking is complete, use a natural release to depressurize. Press cancel.
  - Use tongs to remove the chicken to a cutting board. Shred the chicken with a fork.
  - For a thicker sauce, select sauté and adjust to normal. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes to reduce, stirring frequently. Add the shredded chicken back to the pot and heat through. Press cancel.
  - Serve the chicken mixture in warm tortillas, topped with queso fresco and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
