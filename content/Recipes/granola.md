ingredients:
  - 4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (use certified gluten-free oats for gluten-free granola)
  - 1 1/2 cups raw nuts and/or seeds (1 cup pecans and ½ cup pepitas used here)
  - 1 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt (reduce to ¾ teaspoon if using table salt)
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1/2 cup melted coconut oil or olive oil
  - 1/2 cup maple syrup or honey
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 2/3 cup dried cranberries, chopped if large
  - Optional: 1/2 cup chocolate chips or coconut flakes
directions:
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
  - In a large mixing bowl, combine oats, nuts and/or seeds, salt, and cinnamon. Stir to blend.
  - Add oil, maple syrup or honey, and vanilla. Mix well to coat every oat and nut. Spread the granola evenly on the prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake until lightly golden, about 21 to 24 minutes, stirring halfway through. For clumpier granola, press down with a spatula after stirring.
  - Allow to cool completely, undisturbed, for at least 45 minutes. Add dried fruit and optional chocolate chips. Break into chunks or stir as desired.
  - Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 3 months.
