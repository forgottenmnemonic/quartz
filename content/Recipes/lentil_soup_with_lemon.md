ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 large onion, chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
  - 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/8 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
  - 1 (32-ounce) carton chicken broth
  - 1 cup red lentils
  - 1 large carrot, diced
  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
  - 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
  - 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
  - 1 pinch chili powder, for garnish
directions:
  - Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, and cook until the onion turns golden brown, about 5 minutes.
  - Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, kosher salt, black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon of chili powder. Cook and stir until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes.
  - Add the chicken broth, lentils, and carrot to the pot. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are soft, about 30 minutes.
  - Using a blender or stick blender, pur√©e the soup in batches, leaving it slightly chunky for texture. If using a blender, fill it halfway, pulse a few times, then blend fully before transferring back to the pot.
  - Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Season to taste with additional salt, if needed.
  - Serve the soup in bowls, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle with a pinch of chili powder. Enjoy!
