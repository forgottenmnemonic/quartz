ingredients:
  - 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2 large breasts)
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley flakes
  - 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
  - ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 8 ounces spaghetti (226 grams)
  - ½ cup salted butter
  - 6 medium cloves of garlic (minced)
  - ½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese (divided)
  - 1 tablespoon diced fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)
directions:
  - Pasta- Boil a large pot of salted water. Add pasta to boiling water and cook to al dente, according to the package instructions. Before draining the pasta, reserve 1 cup of the starchy cooking water.
  - Chicken- In a medium bowl, combine the garlic powder, dried parsley, fine sea salt, black pepper, and olive oil. Carefully butterfly the chicken breasts all the way through so you have 4 even filets. Add the chicken to the oil and spice blend and coat evenly. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reads 165°F on an instant-read meat thermometer. Remove the chicken from the pan and cover it with aluminum foil to keep it warm.
  - Butter and Garlic Sauce- Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-low heat, add the minced garlic, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until aromatic. Spoon out half of the garlic butter from the pan into a small bowl. Put the spaghetti into the skillet and toss to coat in the garlic butter. Mix in ¼ cup parmesan cheese, then mix in ⅓ cup of the reserved starchy cooking water. If the sauce still needs thinning, add more starchy water, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.
  - Assemble- Slice the chicken into thin strips and place it on top of the spaghetti or beside it. Spoon the rest of the garlic butter over both the chicken and spaghetti. Garnish with fresh parsley, the remaining parmesan cheese, and black pepper, if desired.
