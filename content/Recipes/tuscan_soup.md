ingredients:
  - 3 tbsp olive oil, divided
  - 1 lb Italian sausage, casing removed (omit for vegetarian)
  - ½ yellow onion, diced
  - ¾ cup celery, diced
  - ¾ cup carrots, diced
  - 1 tsp salt
  - ½ tsp pepper
  - 5 garlic cloves, minced
  - 2 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
  - 1 tsp dried basil
  - ¼ tsp red pepper flakes
  - 3 cups veggie broth
  - 2 cans white beans, drained & rinsed
  - 1 (15 oz) can diced tomatoes
  - 2-3 tbsp sun-dried tomatoes, in oil
  - 2 large handfuls finely chopped kale
  - 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
  - ½ cup half & half (sub coconut milk for dairy-free)
directions:
  - Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add Italian sausage and break it up with a wooden spoon. Cook until fully browned, then transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving any excess grease in the pot.
  - Add 1 more tbsp olive oil, followed by onions, celery, and carrots. Sauté for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened.
  - Stir in salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
  - Add tomato paste, rosemary, dried basil, and red pepper flakes, stirring to coat the vegetables.
  - Pour in veggie broth, white beans, diced tomatoes, and sun-dried tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer for about 15 minutes.
  - Remove from heat and stir in kale, balsamic vinegar, and half & half.
  - For a chunkier soup, leave as is. For a creamier texture, use an immersion blender to partially purée the soup before adding the sausage back in. If using a regular blender, transfer a few cups of soup, blend, and return to the pot.
  - Stir the sausage back in, taste, and adjust seasoning as needed.
