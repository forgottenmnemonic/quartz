ingredients:
  - 1 pound dried black beans, sorted and rinsed
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 1 large onion, diced
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
  - 2 tablespoon diced chipotle en adobo with sauce (or 4 teaspoons chipotle powder)
  - 6 cups water
  - 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
directions:
  - Sauté the aromatics- First, sort and rinse the beans. Heat the vegetable oil in the Instant Pot over Saute mode adjusted to high until the oil is shimmering. (Medium-high heat in a stovetop pressure cooker.) Add the onion and garlic to the pot, sprinkle with the ½ teaspoon sea salt, and then add the diced chipotle. Sauté until the onion softens, about 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot with a flat-edged wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits of onion.
  - Everything in the pot- Stir the rinsed beans into the pot, pour in the water, and then add 1 teaspoon sea salt.
  - Pressure cook for 35 minutes with a quick pressure release- Lock the lid and pressure cook on high pressure for 35 minutes in an Instant Pot or other electric pressure cooker, or for 30 minutes in a stovetop pressure cooker. (On the Instant Pot, use the Manual or Pressure Cooking setting, and set the cook time for 35 minutes.) When the cooking time is over, quick release the pressure in the pot. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to avoid any hot steam. Serve and enjoy!
