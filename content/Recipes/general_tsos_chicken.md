ingredients:
  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  - 1 1/2 pounds chicken, cubed
  - 6 tablespoons rice vinegar
  - 6 tablespoons soy sauce

  - 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
  - 3/4 cup hoisin sauce
  - 4 tablespoons brown sugar
  - 2 tablespoons cornstarch
  - 2 cups cooked white rice
  - 1 green onion, chopped

  - Pour the sesame oil into the Instant Pot. Select sauté and adjust to normal. Add the chicken to the pot. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is white (it does not need to be fully cooked). Press cancel.
  - In a separate bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, crushed red pepper, hoisin sauce, and brown sugar. Pour the mixture over the chicken in the pot. Secure the lid on the pot and close the pressure-release valve.
