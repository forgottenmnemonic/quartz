# Speech Testing

## MCL
MCL script 
“We are going to measure your most comfortable listening level. As I speak point your finger up if you want the volume louder and down when you want it softer. Please tell me when we reach the loudness level you prefer. Do you have any questions?”

## SRT (Speech Recognition Threshold)
textbook pg 167
Start spondee presentation at 30 dB HL, no response jump to 50, no response jump up 20dB

SRT is defined as the lowest level at which *at least 50%* of the responses are correct, with a minimum of three correct responses at that intensity

SRT should be within 10 dB of the pure tone average (PTA) unless the audiogram exhibits an unusual configuration, such as precipitous or reverse slope

## Masking Rules for SRT
textbook pg 170
When masking is needed in the NTE, the initial level of masking is SRT$_N$$_T$$_E$ + 10 dB

## Word Recognition (WRS)
textbook pg 172
Never less than 70 dB?
Starting volume depends on patient's threshold at 2000 Hz:

## Presentation Levels Based on 2000 Hz Threshold
textbook pg 173

| Patient/Client Threshold at 2000 Hz | Present Words at (dB SL) |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Below 50 dB HL                      | 25 dB SL                 |
| 50–55 dB HL                         | 20 dB SL                 |
| 60–65 dB HL                         | 15 dB SL                 |
| 70–75 dB HL                         | 10 dB SL                 |

If a patient has a 2000 Hz threshold of >75 dB HL, there are two options for determining the presentation intensity for word recognition testing:

1. follow the recommendations for patients with a 2000 Hz hearing level of 70-75 dB HL
2. present the word recognition list at the 2000 Hz loudness discomfort level (LDL) minus 5 dB HL
