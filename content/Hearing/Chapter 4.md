# Lesson 6: Acoustics Key Terms 
## Amplitude
The intensity of the energy of a vibrating body.  

## Absorption
The opposite of reflection. Sound is dampened by soft surfaces in an environment and reverberations and echoes are reduced.  

## dB HL reference
Audiometric zero   

## db SPL reference
0.0002 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> or 20Î¼Pa

## Phase
Describes the position in the cycle of one sound wave relative to another

## Rarefaction
When air molecules are less dense and spread further apart than normal.  

## Frequency
Number of complete compression-rarefaction cycles per second

## Compression
When air molecules are pushed together, making the molecular density greater than when at rest.  

## Speed of sound
767 miles per hour or 242 meters per second.  

## Pure tone
Produced by simple repeated alternations of compression and rarafaction.  

## Boyle's Law
States that as the physical volume that contains a gas decreases, the pressure of the gas increases.  

## Acoustics
Branch of physics specializing in sound.  

## Wavelength
The distance between one wave crest or trough and the next.  

## Sound pressure
The deviation from the ambient atmospheric pressure caused by a sound wave.  

## dB HL
Decibels Hearing Level: represents the average softest intensity level that individuals with normal hearing can detect. Audiograms are written in dB HL.  

## Complex wave
Acoustic combination of several different pure tones presented simultaneously.  

## Reflection
Sound that is reflected or bounced around by hard surfaces in the environment. Two types are reverberations and echoes.  

## dB SPL
Decibels Sound Pressure Level: The objective strength of a sound's output not related to any individual's hearing.  

## Resonance
The natural tendency for an object to vibrate with greater amplitude at one frequency than at others when a driving force is applied.  

## dB SL reference
The patient's threshold

## dB SL
Decibels Sensation Level: Sensation level above the patient's threshold. If threshold at 1000 Hz is 20 dB HL and a tone is presented at 40 dB HL, that person is getting a presentation of 20 dB SL.  

## Period
The time required for one complete cycle of compression and rarafaction.  

## Decibel (dB)
Logarithmic scale used to denote the intensity of a sound.
