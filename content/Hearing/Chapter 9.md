# Lesson 23: Masking for Speech Audiometry Key Terms  
## Rule for masking for SRT for insert earphones  
Deliver speech spectrum masking to the NTE when the difference between the unmasked SRT of the TE and the best BC threshold of the NTE is greater than or equal to 60 dB at 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 Hz.   

## Purpose of masking for speech audiometry   
To eliminate participation from the NTE during the measurements being conducted on the TE.   

## Initial masking level for SRT   
Unmasked SRT of the NTE + 10 dB  

## Rule for masking for WR for insert earphones  
Deliver speech spectrum masking noise to the NTE when the difference between the presentation level of the TE and the best BC threshold of the NTE is greater than or equal to 60 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 Hz  

## Speech noise  
The masking noise used for speech audiometry   

## Initial masking level for WR testing  
PL<sub>TE</sub> minus 20 dB.  

## Rule for masking for SRT for supra-aural and circumaural earphones  
Deliver speech spectrum masking to the NTE when the difference between the unmasked SRT of the TE and then best BC threshold of the NTE is greater than or equal to 40 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 Hz.  

## Rule for masking for WR for supra-aural and circumaural headphones
Deliver speech spectrum masking noise to the NTE when the difference between the presentation level of the TE and the best BC threshold of the NTE is greater than or equal to 40 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 Hz.  


# Lesson 24: Additional Testing for the Hearing Aid Fitting Key Terms  
## Threshold of Discomfort (TD)
Also known as UCL or LDL. The intensity at which sound becomes uncomfortably loud. Can be frequency-specific pure tone or for speech. This term is less commonly used than UCL or LDL.  

## Uncomfortable Loudness Level (UCL)
Also known as LCL or TD. The intensity at which sound becomes uncomfortably loud. Can be frequency-specific pure tone or for speech.  

## Binaural interference
The phenomenon whereby a patient's WR scores decrease when listening with both ears.  

## Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL)
Also known as UCL or TD. The intensity at which sound becomes uncomfortably loud. Can be frequency-specific pure tone or for speech.  

## Dynamic Range
The residual auditory area or mathematical difference between the pure tone thresholds and their corresponding pure tone UCLs.  

## QuickSIN
Test developed by Etymotic Research to measure a patient's signal-to-noise ratio pb(SNR) loss. Provides information about the patient's ability to understand speech in the presence of background noise.
